# Starter - A fullstack nodejs starter workspace for the enterprise

## Objective

This project aims to provide a starting point for developing an enterprise-grade full-stack
application on top of Express and NextJs. The only business logic (a.k.a. "feature") is a single
landing page displaying a welcome message. Everything else in this project focuses on providing
an ideal Developer Experience (DX) for adding new features to this base platform.

## Getting Started

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/drkstr101/prism-next)

✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

### System Requirements

All requirements are met by clicking the _Open in Gitpod_ link above. You will need to register a
free account and be prepared to wait about 10 minutes the first time you open it for the image to
be built and cached.

Otherwise one may use any system with docker and node 18 or 20 installed. This project has been
pre-configured for VSCode.

### Start the app

To start all applications and services for development run `yarn start`. Open your browser and navigate to <http://localhost:4200/>.

### Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `yarn nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `yarn nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

### Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```shell
yarn nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```shell
yarn nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```shell
yarn nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

### Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

### Ready to deploy?

Just run `yarn build` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

### Set up CI

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/core-features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/core-features/distribute-task-execution)
